## Make a shortcut to Recycle Bin

To make your own shortcut, just open up the Start Menu folder (type `Win+R`, paste `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`, and hit Enter), create a new shortcut (right-click -> New -> Shortcut), and paste `explorer.exe shell:RecycleBinFolder` into the prompt. Give it a name (Recycle Bin Shortcut, perhaps?)
